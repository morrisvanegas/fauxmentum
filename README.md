# fauxmentum

# change background images
Upload images to /earthporn directory. Number images 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc. 
Update NUMBEROFBACKGROUNDIMAGES in index.html to the number of images you have.
The demo at morrisvanegas.com/fauxmentum displays a random image from /r/earthporn (top 50 based on Imgur's most viewed sorted by all time)

# change the quotes
Update the quotes.txt file with your own quotes. Each quote needs to be on a new line because I used the \n to check how many quotes there are. 
Update NUMBEROFQUOTES in index.html to the number of quotes you have.
